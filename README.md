Fundamentals of Natural Language Processing I

It is a brief project that I conducted to study the NLTK and TextBlob libraries. I am interested in how, from different libraries, certain specific procedures like tokenization and part-of-speech tagging operate. Text pre-processing in general. I have taken fundamentals from https://www.kaggle.com/ and https://nlp.stanford.edu/.
